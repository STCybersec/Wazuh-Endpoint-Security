📘 Vulnerability Detection Module

Wazuh Blue Team Project — Endpoint Security Portfolio

This module demonstrates how I used Wazuh’s Vulnerability Detector to identify, classify, and report software vulnerabilities across monitored endpoints. The project simulates a real-world SOC workflow where outdated applications, insecure configurations, or missing patches are detected and escalated as actionable security findings.

The goal of this repository is to show practical threat detection capability, CVE exposure mapping, and enterprise-style reporting for vulnerability management.

🧩 Project Overview

Wazuh’s Vulnerability Detector integrates multiple security intelligence sources (NVD, OVAL, MSU, Canonical, etc.) to automatically identify vulnerabilities in installed software.

This project includes:

Automated vulnerability scanning on Windows endpoints

Proper Syscollector inventory configuration

Real sample alerts for high-severity CVEs

Compliance alignment (CIS, PCI DSS, MITRE ATT&CK)

A realistic case study involving outdated software

A remediation plan demonstrating patch management workflow

🛠️ Key Features Implemented
✔ Automated Vulnerability Scanning

Wazuh was configured to continuously scan all endpoints for vulnerable software using NVD and OVAL feeds.

✔ Software Inventory Tracking

Syscollector was enabled on endpoints to collect:

Installed software list

Application versions

Packages and components

System information

This data powers the vulnerability correlation engine.

✔ High-Fidelity CVE Mapping

Simulated real-world CVEs including:

CVE-2023-21768 — Windows Common Log File System RCE

CVE-2024-21413 — Outlook RCE

Legacy application vulnerabilities (7zip, VLC, Notepad++)

✔ SOC-Style Reporting

All detected vulnerabilities include:

Severity (Low → Critical)

CVSS score

Attack vector (AV:N, AV:L, etc.)

Exploit availability

Fix / patch reference

MITRE ATT&CK mapping

✔ Remediation Plan

A full patch-management response is documented:

Risk assessment

Prioritized patching

Verification

Validation of patched systems

🔍 Case Study Scenario (Included in docs/narrative.md)

The project includes a detailed scenario where an outdated application is discovered on a monitored Windows endpoint. Wazuh detects multiple CVEs, one of them classified as Critical based on CVSS scoring.

The narrative covers:

How the vulnerability was detected

Threat intelligence correlation

Why the vulnerability is dangerous

The remediation steps

Expected SOC response

📁 Screenshots Included

The following images are included under /docs/:

Vulnerabilities Dashboard

Agent Vulnerabilities List

Detailed CVE Information (with CVSS, EPSS, Description)

Exploitability / Risk Analysis

These visually demonstrate the detection pipeline functioning end-to-end.

⚙️ Configurations

All configuration files used for the project are included:

vulnerability-detection.conf — enables and configures the module

vuln_rules.xml — custom alert tuning

Manager & agent ossec.conf — required scanning and wodule settings

These can be reused in any Wazuh environment.

🧪 Sample Alerts

Raw Wazuh alert JSON files are provided under /sample-alerts/ for authenticity and technical transparency. These were exported directly from the dashboard.

🚀 How to Use This Module

Navigate to the configs/ directory to replicate the setup

Review case study under docs/narrative.md

Inspect raw CVE JSON alerts under sample-alerts/

Use scripts in scripts/ to trigger re-scans and generate controlled exposure
