## 📘 Vulnerability Detection Module

Wazuh Blue Team Project - Endpoint Security Portfolio

This module demonstrates how I used Wazuh’s Vulnerability Detector to identify, classify, and report software vulnerabilities across monitored endpoints. The project simulates a real-world SOC workflow where outdated applications/softwares, insecure configurations, or missing patches are detected and escalated as actionable security findings.

The goal of this repository is to show practical threat detection capability, CVE exposure mapping, and enterprise-style reporting for vulnerability management.

## 🧩 Project Overview

Wazuh’s Vulnerability Detector integrates multiple security intelligence sources (NVD, OVAL, MSU, Canonical, etc.) to automatically identify vulnerabilities in installed software.

This project includes:

- Automated vulnerability scanning on Windows endpoints

- Proper Syscollector inventory configuration

- Real sample alerts for high-severity CVEs

- A realistic case study involving outdated software

- A remediation plan demonstrating patch management workflow

---

## 🛠️ Key Features Implemented

✔ Automated Vulnerability Scanning

- Wazuh was configured to continuously scan all endpoints for vulnerable software.

✔ Software Inventory Tracking

- Syscollector was enabled on endpoints to collect:

- Installed software list

- Application versions

- Packages and components

- System information

---

## This data powers the vulnerability correlation engine.

✔ High-Fidelity CVE Mapping

Simulated real-world CVEs including:

- CVE-2025-4918 - Mozilla Firefox 126.0

- CVE-2023-24881 - Microsoft Teams

- Legacy application vulnerabilities (7zip, VLC, Notepad++)

✔ SOC-Style Reporting

---

All detected vulnerabilities include:

- Severity (Low → Critical)

- CVSS score

- Attack vector (AV:N, AV:L, etc.)

- Exploit availability

- Fix / patch reference

---

## 🔍 Case Study Scenario (Included in docs/narrative.md)

The project includes a detailed scenario where an outdated application is discovered on a monitored Windows endpoint. Wazuh detects multiple CVEs, one of them classified as Critical based on CVSS scoring.

The narrative covers:

- How the vulnerability was detected

- Threat intelligence correlation

- Why the vulnerability is dangerous

- The remediation steps

- Expected SOC response

---

## 📁 Screenshots Included

The following images are included under /docs/:

- Vulnerabilities Dashboard

- Agent Vulnerabilities List

- Detailed CVE Information (with CVSS, EPSS, Description)

- Exploitability / Risk Analysis

- These visually demonstrate the detection pipeline functioning end-to-end.

---

## ⚙️ Configurations

All configuration files used for the project are included:

- vulnerability-detection.conf - enables and configures the module

- vuln_rules.xml - custom alert tuning

- Manager & agent ossec.conf - required scanning and wodule settings

- These can be reused in any Wazuh environment.

---

## 🧪 Sample Alerts

Raw Wazuh alert JSON files are provided under /sample-alerts/ for authenticity and technical transparency. These were exported directly from the dashboard.

## 🚀 How to Use This Module

- Navigate to the configs/ directory to replicate the setup

- Review case study under docs/narrative.md

- Inspect raw CVE JSON alerts under sample-alerts/

- Use scripts in scripts/ to trigger re-scans and generate controlled exposure
